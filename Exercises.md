# Unix Tutorial Exercises

This document details the exercises completed during the Unix Tutorial, including commands used, their outcomes, and practical applications.

## Exercise 1a: Create a Directory
- **Command**: `mkdir backups`
- **Outcome**: A new directory named `backups` was created inside the `unixstuff` directory.
- **Purpose**: To learn how to create new directories for organizing files.

## Exercise 1b: Navigating the File System
- **Commands Used**: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
- **Outcome**: Practiced navigating the file system, listing the contents of directories, and viewing the current directory path.
- **Purpose**: To develop familiarity with moving through the Unix file system and understanding directory structure.

## Exercise 2a: Creating a Backup of a File
- **Command**: `cp science.txt science.bak`
- **Outcome**: Created a copy of `science.txt` named `science.bak` in the same directory.
- **Purpose**: To understand how to make backups of files using the `cp` command.

## Exercise 2b: Create and Remove a Directory
- **Commands**: `mkdir tempstuff`, `rmdir tempstuff`
- **Outcome**: Created and then removed an empty directory named `tempstuff`.
- **Purpose**: To learn how to create and remove directories, emphasizing the importance of managing empty directories.

## Additional Exercises
- **Copying Files to a Directory**:
  - **Command**: `cp science.txt backups/`
  - **Outcome**: Copied `science.txt` to the `backups` directory.
  - **Purpose**: To practice moving files between directories for better organization.

- **Moving and Renaming Files**:
  - **Command**: `mv science.bak backups/`
  - **Outcome**: Moved `science.bak` to the `backups` directory.
  - **Purpose**: To learn how to move files and understand the difference between moving and copying.

- **Removing Files**:
  - **Command**: `rm tempfile.txt`
  - **Outcome**: Deleted the file `tempfile.txt`.
  - **Purpose**: To understand how to remove unwanted files from the system.

## Practical Applications
- These exercises provided hands-on practice with essential commands that are commonly used in managing files and directories within a Unix/Linux environment.
- The skills developed through these exercises are foundational for tasks like setting up file structures, managing backups, and navigating complex directory hierarchies in software development and system administration roles.
